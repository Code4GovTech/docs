 </head>

## Goal
The C4GT community forms the core of the C4GT program, serving as a dynamic bridge between contributors and organizations. It facilitates collaboration by presenting problem statements as actionable tickets and enables seamless end-to-end tracking and management using C4GT's proprietary technology modules.
## Product
### Exploring Contribution Opportunities:


Users visit the C4GT website to discover opportunities to contribute and they join the C4GT community through an onboarding process.

### Community Engagement:


After joining the community server, users connect with participating organizations and fellow contributors for collaboration and support in achieving ticket milestones. This fosters a collaborative environment for learning and growth.

### Ticket Tracking:

Users explore available tickets on the website and on GitHub. The C4GT community bot collects all relevant ticket-related data including ticket content, status updates (open, in-progress, closed), comments and discussions on tickets, timestamps of activities, Pull Requests (PRs) raised and merged, etc.

### Role Assignment:


Based on the data collected by the bot, contributors are assigned specific roles to reflect their progress and contributions.

### Ticket Closure and Points Allocation:


When contributors submit solutions, ticket owners review and close the tickets upon acceptance. Points are then awarded to contributors based on the difficulty level of the tickets.

### Leaderboard and Recognition:

Points are reflected on a leaderboard displayed on the C4GT website and contributors are ranked based on their accumulated points, providing recognition for their efforts.
